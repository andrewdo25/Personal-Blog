# Some first words

***Sweet***, my blog, is a storybook of mine that is about all aspects of my life, and knowledge I learned in a life of living (I’m not sure about that, my life is quite boring). I am a data scientist. I am excited to share my experiences and insights with you about data science, artificial intelligence, and other topics that interest me.

> *Why did I name my site “Sweet”?*

Good question. I don’t know, too. I feel it is catchy 😎😎. I am not sure if I will keep it or not, but for now, it is good.

When it comes to AI and Data Science, there is always something new to learn. It's a field that is constantly evolving, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it. As a data scientist, my job involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting large amounts of data to solve complex problems. I've always been fascinated by the power of data and the insights that can be gleaned from it.

But there's more to life than just work, and I believe in enjoying the journey as much as reaching the destination. That's why I plan to share some personal stories on this blog, too.

So blogging is not the main target of this site. I have a bad memory, so writing things down is the best way to store them, and maybe it could be helpful for some people. I will mainly talk about everything in my development path.  It can be covered from casual stories when coding, some tips, hacks, and everything I learn and share with you. I want this to be a space where you can come to learn and grow, just like I am. From technical tutorials to casual stories, there will be a little bit of everything here. I believe that knowledge is power, and I want to help you unlock your full potential. I will dive deeper into the topic in the below [section](#topics-i-plan-to-cover).

This site includes 3 parts: [Guidelines](https://andoDsAI.github.io/categories/guideline/), [Blogs](https://andoDsAI.github.io/categories/blog/), and [Projects](https://andoDsAI.github.io/categories/project/)

1. **Guideline**: My how-to on almost everything in development and life. From tips on how to live a better life to coding hacks, I will share everything I know and help you improve in all areas of your life.
2. **Blog**: As its name suggests, it is about my personal stories. I will share my experiences and lessons learned in a fun and engaging way.
3. **Project**: That’s the main one. In addition to blogging, I also have a strong passion for projects. I will document my projects here so that you can get a full overview of the process and dive into the details if you're interested. I hope that these projects will inspire you and give you some ideas for your work.

I really want to document everything, so that if someone wants to learn, or I when forget, can go to the site, read the blog, do some practice with it, and we could save a lot of time. My documenting skill is not so good, so if there are some typos or misleading information, leave a comment in the comment section, or contact me so I can fix it as quickly as possible.

# Topics I plan to cover

I am a Data Scientist, so obviously my main posts will be around AI and Data Science. Below are the topics that interest me.

## Data Science

Data science is a vast field that involves the use of statistical and computational methods to extract insights and knowledge from data. In my blog, I plan to share some of the tools and techniques I use to analyze data and build predictive models. What I share can also be the difference when we work with real data compared to when we use published data sets when studying and researching. Some of the challenges I faced and how I overcame them, or maybe some other interesting things such as some questions during the Data Scientist interview for example.

## Artificial Intelligence

I am also interested in Artificial Intelligence (AI), so I will talk about some AI topics, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and some other related topics. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting and rapidly evolving fields in technology today. AI has the potential to transform the way we live and work, and I will share my insights into some of the latest breakthroughs in AI research and their potential applications.

## Other topics

When I wrote this post, I only planned to talk about the above, but as I say, it is not flexible, and I will write down everything as long as I know about it. So stay focused, and ask me if you want to know something.

For example, I can talk about books, materials, coffee, some helpful links, and other things that help people. If you have something want to share with me, please let me know in the comment or contact me.

# Conclusion

I'm really excited to share this journey with you. Here is my post about the aim of this blog. I do not expect much about that, but I hope it could help someone in the future.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them in the comments section or contact me directly. Thank you for reading, and I can't wait to share more with you soon!

I hope to bring joy and inspiration to your day. Thank you!
